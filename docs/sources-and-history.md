# Sources and history

Polycart keeps two kinds of record about a cart:

- **`source`** on the cart: the surface it was created through, or last converted through.
- **Its history**, kept by [jayi/keen](https://github.com/jayjfletcher/Keen), the audit log every jayi package shares: one entry per change, with who made it, through which surface, what changed and why. Polycart keeps no history of its own; without Keen installed, carts keep none.

This guide covers:

- [Sources](#sources)
- [Setting the source](#setting-the-source)
- [History](#history)
- [What gets recorded](#what-gets-recorded)
- [Where a cart came from](#where-a-cart-came-from)
- [Recording your own events](#recording-your-own-events)
- [Reading history](#reading-history)
- [In the Atrium dashboard](#in-the-atrium-dashboard)
- [Upgrading from the activity log](#upgrading-from-the-activity-log)

## Sources

A cart's `source` is the surface it was created through, as jayi/foundation's `Surface` names it, the same name the audit log records with every entry:

| Source | When |
| --- | --- |
| `http` | The JSON API (any `polycart.*` route) |
| `mcp` | The MCP server |
| `cortex` | A Cortex agent calling a cart tool. See [Cortex](cortex.md). |
| `atrium` | The Atrium dashboard |
| `cli` | A console command or queued job, outside any of the above |
| `code` | Anything else |

A source is stored as a plain string, so you can name your own (`web`, `import`, `pos`). A cart converted in place, or copied by a conversion, takes the source of the conversion.

## Setting the source

**Around a block of code**, with `Polycart::usingSource()`, a shortcut for Foundation's `Surface::using()`:

```php
use JayI\Polycart\Facades\Polycart;

Polycart::usingSource('import', function () use ($rows) {
    foreach ($rows as $row) {
        Polycart::create('cart', $row['customer'])->add(Product::find($row['id']), $row['qty']);
    }
});
```

The surface is restored afterwards, even when the callback throws, and blocks can be nested. Audit entries recorded inside the block carry the same surface.

**On your own routes**, name the surface for a route-name prefix once, from a service provider:

```php
use JayI\Foundation\Support\Surface;

app(Surface::class)->route('checkout.', 'web');
```

API and MCP callers cannot choose a source; it always names the surface they used.

## History

With jayi/keen installed, every change made through Polycart's actions is recorded as an entry with source `polycart`:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | What happened, as `noun.verb`: `line.added`, `cart.transitioned`, `carts.merged` |
| `subject` | The cart the entry is about, labelled with its `label` or id |
| `actor` | The signed-in user, when there is one |
| `surface` | `http`, `mcp`, `cortex`, `atrium`, `cli`, `code` or yours |
| `changes` | The cart's fields that changed, as `[old, new]` |
| `context` | Details of the change, such as the line and quantity |

Entries are append-only and hash-chained; see Keen's README for retention, verification and authorization.

## What gets recorded

Every action Polycart takes announces itself through its action events, and Keen records the finished ones. Reads (`*Listed`, `*Shown`) are not recorded.

| Action | When | Subject | Context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cart.created` | A cart is created | the cart | |
| `cart.updated` | The label or meta changes | the cart | |
| `cart.deleted` | The cart is deleted | the cart | |
| `cart.cleared` | Every line is removed at once | the cart | |
| `cart.transitioned` | The status moves | the cart | `from`, `to` |
| `cart.converted` | The cart is retyped in place, or copied into another type | the converted cart (the copy, or the retyped cart) | `from`, `to`, `copy`, and on a copy `converted_from` (the original's id) |
| `carts.merged` | Another cart's lines were merged into this one | the cart merged into | `merged_from` (the merged cart's id) |
| `line.added` / `lines.added` | Lines are added | the cart | `line`, `purchasable_type`, `purchasable_id`, `quantity`, `merged` / `lines` |
| `line.updated` / `lines.updated` | A line's quantity or price changes | the cart | `line`, `quantity`, `unit_price` |
| `line.removed` / `lines.removed` | Lines are removed | the cart | `line` / `lines` |
| `cart.shared` | A member is added, or their role changes | the cart | `member_type`, `member_id`, `role` |
| `cart.unshared` | A member is removed | the cart | `member_type`, `member_id` |
| `visibility.changed` | Visibility changes | the cart | `from`, `to` |

The line, sharing, merge and conversion events implement `JayI\Foundation\Audit\Contracts\Auditable` to name the cart as their subject. Carts and lines are labelled through Foundation's `AuditHooks`.

## Where a cart came from

A cart's history answers where it came from. A cart that received another's lines has a `carts.merged` entry naming the merged cart in `merged_from`; a copy made by a conversion has a `cart.converted` entry naming the original in `converted_from`. Follow the id to read the other cart's own history. Histories are no longer copied from cart to cart.

## Recording your own events

Record your application's own events with Keen's facade. They are stored with source `app`:

```php
use JayI\Keen\Facades\Keen;

Keen::record('cart.exported')->on($cart)->with(['reference' => $salesOrder->number])->save();
```

`$cart->recordActivity('exported', [...])` still works, but is deprecated: it calls `Keen::record('cart.exported')->on($cart)->with([...])->save()` (an action without a dot gets the `cart.` prefix) when Keen is installed, and does nothing otherwise.

## Reading history

| Surface | Read |
| --- | --- |
| JSON API | `GET /polycart/history?subject_type=...&subject_id=...` (named `polycart.history.index`), filterable by `action`, cursor paginated |
| MCP | `list-polycart-history-tool` with the same arguments |
| Keen | Its own API, MCP tools and Atrium screens, across every package |

`subject_type` is the cart's morph class (`$cart->getMorphClass()`). Reading one cart's history needs `view` on that cart; reading the whole of Polycart's needs the `viewAuditLog` Gate ability when your application defines it. Both answer "not installed" until an audit log is.

Carts can still be listed by source: `CartModel::query()->fromSource('mcp')`, `GET /polycart/carts?source=mcp`, or `list-carts {source}`.

## In the Atrium dashboard

The cart page shows the cart's source and its history, newest first, through Atrium's `<x-atrium::audit-trail source="polycart" :subject="$cart" />`. The carts page shows Polycart's recent history across every cart to those who may read it. Both render nothing until Keen is installed.

## Upgrading from the activity log

Polycart used to keep its own activity log. It is replaced by Keen:

- `polycart_cart_activities` is no longer created, and the `sources` column on `polycart_carts` is gone from new installs. Existing installs keep both, untouched and unused; drop them when you no longer need the old entries.
- `$cart->activities`, `CartActivityModel`, the `Activity` and `CartSource` enums, `SourceContext`, the `CartSource` middleware, `CartModel::scopeTouchedBy()` and the `touched_by` filter are removed.
- `GET /polycart/carts/{cart}/activity` and the `list-cart-activity` tool are removed in favour of `GET /polycart/history?subject_type=...&subject_id=...` and `list-polycart-history-tool`.
- The JSON API's source is now `http` (was `api`), and work outside every surface is `cli` or `code` (was `polycart.default_source`, which is removed).
